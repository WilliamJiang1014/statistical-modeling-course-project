# Statistical Modeling Course Project

This repository contains the final project for the course **Statistical Analysis and Modeling (统计分析与建模)**.

## Project Topic

Direction 3 from the project proposal: **Diabetes patients' 30-day readmission risk and length of stay**.

We aim to:

- Analyze risk factors associated with 30-day readmission for diabetes inpatients.
- Build interpretable statistical models for:
  - A **classification task**: whether a patient will be readmitted within 30 days.
  - A **regression task**: the expected length of stay (LOS) for a given admission.
- Develop a simple prototype system to visualize the data and model results.

## Repository Structure

- `code/` – Data preprocessing, EDA, modeling scripts, and prototype system source code.
- `data/` – Project datasets (raw and processed).  
  - Please ensure data size stays within the course requirement (≤ 10 MB).
- `docs/` – Project proposal, report drafts, slides, and other documentation.

## Course Requirements Mapping

This project will cover:

- Data collection, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- At least **two types of statistical models** (regression + classification).
- Model evaluation, interpretation of parameters, and application analysis.
- A small prototype system to demonstrate visualizations and model outputs.
- Public hosting of data, code, documentation, and a short project video via GitHub.
